# Etch-a-Sketch
A Vanilla JavaScript exercise specifically aimed at DOM manipulation with the following goals:

- Creating a 16x16 grid of square div-elements using JavaScript only
- Adding a hover effect to change a square to a random color and having the color going 10% darker for each passing through of the cursor
- Creating a new custom-sized grid in the same area with the click of a button and the user input for the number of rows/columns
